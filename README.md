# Approximation-Bridges
Approximating Non Differentiable functions using non-linear transformations through layers of tiny neural networks.
These could be then used as activation functions for other neural networks.

Pytorch modules for the functions are located in the functions models, and the saved weights for those in the saved_models folder.

Functions approximated so far...
